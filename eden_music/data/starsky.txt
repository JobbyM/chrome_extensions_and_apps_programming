Star Sky - Two Steps From HellHere we areRiding the skyPainting the night with sunYou and I Mirrors of lightTwin flames of fireLit in another time and placeI knew your nameI knew your faceYour love and gracePast and present now embraceWorlds collide in inner spaceUnstoppable the song we playBurn the page for meI cannot erase the time of sleepI cannot be loved so set me freeI cannot deliver your loveOr caress your soul soturn that page for meI cannot embrace the touch that you giveI cannot find solace in your wordsI cannot deliver you your loveor caress your soulAge to ageI feel the callMemory of future dreamsYou and I riding the skyKeeping the fire brightFrom another time and placeI know your nameI know your faceYour touch and graceAll of time can not eraseWhat our hearts remember staysForever on a song we playBurn the page for meI cannot erase the time of sleepI cannot be loved so set me freeI cannot deliver your loveOr caress your soul soturn that page for meI cannot embrace the touch that you giveI cannot find solace in your wordsI cannot deliver you your loveor caress your soul
